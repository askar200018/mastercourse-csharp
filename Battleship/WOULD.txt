SO This is would framework

we have 25 spotted grid, and there are some ships
2 users fight with each other

they can select ships, 2 long, 2 medium, 1 small

Win who destroyed all of oponents ships

Ask only name? I think this enough.
Then choose, where to put his ships.
Do this to second playe also.
Game start, they pick cell, and we prompt hited, or missed.
Then turn switch.

When all ships destoryed, prompt the winner.
End and application.

**************** W & O ****************

------ PRO TIP -------
Planning does not mean perfect.
Identify the big picture and try to ask good questions.


************** U, L & D *****************
U - User interface, is console. And after each shot we show picture of grid. 
And show where he hit, and missed. X for hit, O for miss, *(star) for unknown.

L - Ask where to put ships. Create 2 grids, with ships. And after each shot, change grid view, and check status.

D - So we need class for Grid, Game, Ship. Game have 2 Grids, with 5 ships each. 
We have value to know who's turn. So we need also some info, about how many shots are taken.
Data info we can store in grid.
And we have winner, if someone wins. We end application, and show data.


-------- PRO TIP ---------
Planning your data and UI on paper will make 
starting off your application much easier.
